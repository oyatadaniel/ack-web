            <p>KAMA is a department in the ACK

                It is the youngest department both in the Province of Kenya and the Diocese Before KAMA we had various associations dealing with men issues even though some dioceses had those associations while some didn’t

                These associations were Fathers Union and Fathers Association. Maseno North diocese had fathers’ association while Mount Kenya South was the first to start fathers’ union in 1985

                Each association above had its own constitution and therefore there was no co-ordination at the Provincial level

                To achieve this a number of meetings were held at the Provincial level between 2000 and 2001 to harmonize the constitution and establish one department under one umbrella of the Kenya Anglican Men Association, easily referred to as KAMA. The provincial KAMA received the recognition and blessing of the Provincial Synod in July 2001.

                KAMA was launched in Maseno North diocese in September 2021 with the enrollment of about 80 men were enrolled by Simon Oketch Bishop Emeritus

                Then Archbishop the Most rev. Dr. David kitari visited the diocese and was able to enroll 142 more men both of whom were the clergy in 2021

                Up to today the association has over 1000 members</p>

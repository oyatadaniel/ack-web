        <p>Children’s ministry is one of the oldest departments in the diocese and it focuses on the Sunday services for the Children and other follow-up forums done either at home or in church.<br>

        <strong>The Boys’ Brigade and The Girls</strong><br>

        Brigade is a Christian uniformed, disciplined, international, non-denominational organization for boys and girls.  Its main objective is to make the boys and girls mature in their faith and also acquire life skills that will make them all rounded Christians who are knowledgeable and able to participate in the society issues around them. The children graduate from one level to another based on their age in the course of the program.

        The Brigade is the mentor-ship arm of the Children Ministry designed to impart life skills on the Boys as they grow to become men and Girls grow to become women.

        The aim of the children ministry is leading children into a living relationship with Jesus Christ. The ministry focuses on entrenching the Christian foundation through teaching, mentor-ship and capacity building and enabling them to grow in faith and live life in its fullness. The diocese has identified this as a strategic ministry and will invest adequate resources in it. Effective children ministry will be achieved through development of appropriate curriculum, identification of necessary infrastructure and commitment of financial resources with special emphasis on staffing and capacity building of ministry workers.

        This ministry was created to cater for the transition group between Sunday School and Youth mostly for those aged between 13 and 18 years. It is meant to take over for those who get confirmed by the Bishop to continue disciplining them and reaching out to them and their age-mates in schools. We refer to those who instruct Teens as Teens’ Mentors because of the coaching role they also are expected to play.

        The brigade forms the core function of the children’s ministry however we have other functions of the ministry as follows</p>
